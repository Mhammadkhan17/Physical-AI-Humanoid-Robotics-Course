title: Simulating Physics in Gazebo
---

Before a robot can walk, it must learn to fall. Welcome to Gazebo, a powerful 3D robotics simulator that allows us to safely and accurately test our robots in a virtual environment. For Physical AI, simulation is not just a convenience—it's a necessity. It allows us to iterate on our designs, train our AI models, and test control algorithms thousands of times in a fraction of the time and cost it would take with a real robot.

This chapter focuses on the heart of Gazebo: its physics engine. We'll explore how to simulate gravity, define how objects collide, and give them realistic physical properties.

## The Gazebo World

Every Gazebo simulation takes place in a **World**. A world is defined in a `.world` file, which is written in **SDF (Simulation Description Format)**. This file is a complete blueprint of your virtual environment, containing everything from lighting and robots to the fundamental laws of physics that govern it.

## The Force of Gravity

One of the most fundamental forces in our physical reality is gravity. In Gazebo, we can define the gravitational vector for the entire world. This force will act on every object that has mass.

You define gravity within the `<world>` element of your `.world` file. The standard gravity for Earth is -9.8 m/s² on the Z-axis.

```xml
<sdf version="1.7">
  <world name="my_world">
    
    <!-- Set the gravity for the entire world -->
    <gravity>0 0 -9.8</gravity>

    <!-- Other elements like lights, models, etc. go here -->
    <include>
      <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
    </include>
    
  </world>
</sdf>
```
With this simple line, every model you add to the world will be pulled "downward" along the Z-axis.

## Collisions: What the Simulator "Sees"

In the previous module, we discussed the `<visual>` tag in a URDF, which defines what a robot link looks like. For the physics engine, however, what's more important is the **`<collision>`** tag. This tag defines the link's physical shape for calculating interactions.

### Visual vs. Collision Geometry

For performance, the collision geometry should almost always be simpler than the visual geometry. A physics engine can calculate the intersection of two simple boxes far more quickly than the intersection of two highly detailed 3D meshes with thousands of polygons.

*   **`<visual>`**: A high-polygon mesh for realistic appearance.
*   **`<collision>`**: A simple primitive shape (box, cylinder, sphere) that approximates the visual mesh.

Here is an example for a robot link. The visual part is a detailed mesh, but the collision part is a simple cylinder that envelops it.

```xml
<link name="forearm">
  <visual>
    <geometry>
      <mesh filename="package://my_robot/meshes/detailed_forearm.dae"/>
    </geometry>
  </visual>
  <collision>
    <geometry>
      <cylinder radius="0.05" length="0.3"/>
    </geometry>
  </collision>
  <inertial>
    <!-- Mass and inertia properties here -->
  </inertial>
</link>
```

## Surface Properties: Making Collisions Realistic

What happens when two objects collide? Do they bounce? Do they slide? The `<surface>` tag, placed inside the `<collision>` tag, lets us define these crucial physical properties.

Key properties are defined within `<friction>` and `<contact>` elements:

*   **Friction**: Determines how "grippy" a surface is.
    *   `<mu>`: Coefficient of static friction. The force required to start an object moving.
    *   `<mu2>`: Coefficient of dynamic friction. The force required to keep an object moving.
*   **Restitution (Bounciness)**:
    *   `<restitution_coefficient>`: A value from 0.0 to 1.0. A value of `0.0` means the object will not bounce at all (like a lump of clay), while `1.0` represents a perfectly elastic collision (like a superball).
*   **Contact Stiffness and Damping**:
    *   `<kp>`: The stiffness coefficient of the contact.
    *   `<kd>`: The damping coefficient of the contact.
    
These values help the physics engine determine how "hard" or "soft" a collision is, preventing objects from passing through each other.

### Example: Rubber Ball vs. Wood Block

Let's define the surface properties for a very bouncy rubber ball:
```xml
<collision name="ball_collision">
  <geometry>
    <sphere radius="0.1"/>
  </geometry>
  <surface>
    <friction>
      <mu>0.8</mu>
      <mu2>0.6</mu2>
    </friction>
    <contact>
      <restitution_coefficient>0.9</restitution_coefficient>
      <kp>1000000.0</kp>
      <kd>100.0</kd>
    </contact>
  </surface>
</collision>
```

Now, let's define a heavy, non-bouncy wood block:
```xml
<collision name="block_collision">
  <geometry>
    <box size="0.5 0.5 0.5"/>
  </geometry>
  <surface>
    <friction>
      <mu>0.6</mu>
      <mu2>0.5</mu2>
    </friction>
    <contact>
      <restitution_coefficient>0.01</restitution_coefficient>
      <kp>10000000.0</kp>
      <kd>1.0</kd>
    </contact>
  </surface>
</collision>
```

## The Physics Engine

Gazebo's architecture is modular, meaning you can choose from several different physics engines. The default and most common engine is the **ODE (Open Dynamics Engine)**. However, Gazebo also supports others like **Bullet**, **Simbody**, and **DART**.

You can specify the engine and its properties in the `.world` file:

```xml
<world name="my_world">
  <physics type="ode">
    <max_step_size>0.001</max_step_size>
    <real_time_factor>1</real_time_factor>
    <real_time_update_rate>1000</real_time_update_rate>
  </physics>
  ...
</world>
```
For this course, we will primarily use the default ODE engine, but it's important to know that other options exist, each with different trade-offs between speed and simulation accuracy.

By carefully defining the physical properties of your robot and its environment, you create a high-fidelity "digital twin"—a virtual sandbox where the laws of physics closely mirror reality, providing a reliable testbed for your AI.
