title: Understanding URDF for Humanoids
---

Every robot, whether in a simulation or the real world, needs a "blueprint." In the ROS ecosystem, this blueprint is the **Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)**. It's an XML-based file that precisely describes the robot's physical structure, from its limbs and joints to its visual appearance and physical properties. For humanoids, a well-structured URDF is the essential foundation for everything from basic visualization to complex motion planning.

This chapter breaks down the core components of a URDF file and how they come together to model a humanoid robot.

## The Core Components: `<link>` and `<joint>`

A URDF file describes a robot as a **kinematic tree**—a series of rigid bodies called **links** that are connected by **joints**.

The entire description is wrapped in a single root element: `<robot name="my_humanoid">`.

### The `<link>` Element: The Robot's Body

A `<link>` represents a physical part of the robot, like a torso, an upper arm, or a foot. It has three key sub-elements that define its appearance and physical behavior:

1.  **`<visual>`**: This defines what the link *looks like*. It's used by visualization tools like RViz.
    *   `<geometry>`: Can be a simple shape (`<box>`, `<cylinder>`, `<sphere>`) or a 3D mesh file (`<mesh filename="package://my_robot/meshes/torso.dae"/>`).
    *   `<material>`: Defines the color and texture of the link.
2.  **`<collision>`**: This defines the link's "collision geometry" for the physics simulator. It should be a simpler shape than the visual mesh to speed up calculations. If omitted, collisions are often disabled for that link.
3.  **`<inertial>`**: This defines the link's *physical properties*:
    *   `<mass>`: The mass of the link (e.g., in kilograms).
    *   `<inertia>`: The rotational inertia tensor, which describes how the link's mass is distributed and how it resists rotational motion.
    *   `<origin>`: Defines the link's center of mass.

### The `<joint>` Element: Connecting the Body

A `<joint>` connects two links together and defines their relationship—how they are allowed to move relative to each other.

1.  **`<parent link="..."/>`** and **`<child link="..."/>`**: These two tags define the tree structure. Every child can have only one parent, which prevents kinematic loops.
2.  **`<origin xyz="..." rpy="..."/>`**: This is crucial. It defines the pose (position and orientation) of the child link's coordinate frame relative to the parent link's frame. `xyz` is the position offset, and `rpy` is the orientation in roll, pitch, and yaw.
3.  **`<axis xyz="..."/>`**: Defines the axis of motion for `revolute` and `prismatic` joints. For example, `xyz="0 0 1"` means the joint rotates around the Z-axis.
4.  **`type` attribute**: This specifies the type of motion allowed by the joint. The most common types for humanoids are:
    *   **`revolute`**: A hinge joint that rotates around a single axis with defined upper and lower limits (e.g., an elbow).
    *   **`continuous`**: A revolute joint with no limits (e.g., a wheel, less common in humanoids).
    *   **`prismatic`**: A sliding joint that moves along an axis (rare in humanoids).
    *   **`fixed`**: A rigid connection that allows no movement. Used to fuse multiple links together.
5.  **`<limit>`**: For `revolute` and `prismatic` joints, this tag sets the operational range.
    *   `lower` and `upper`: The minimum and maximum joint position (e.g., in radians for a revolute joint).
    *   `velocity`: The maximum speed of the joint.
    *   `effort`: The maximum force or torque the joint can apply.

## Building a Humanoid: A Simple Arm Example

A full humanoid URDF is very long, but the principle is simple: start with a root link and build the tree outwards. A common root link for a humanoid is the **`pelvis`** or **`base_link`**.

Let's model a simplified arm with a torso, an upper arm, and a shoulder joint connecting them.

```xml
<robot name="simple_humanoid">

  <!-- 1. The Parent Link: The Torso -->
  <link name="torso">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.4 0.6 0.2"/>
      </geometry>
      <material name="gray">
        <color rgba="0.5 0.5 0.5 1.0"/>
      </material>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.4 0.6 0.2"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    <inertial>
      <mass value="10.0"/>
      <inertia ixx="1.0" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0" iyy="1.0" iyz="0.0" izz="1.0"/>
    </inertial>
  </link>

  <!-- 2. The Child Link: The Upper Arm -->
  <link name="right_upper_arm">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <cylinder radius="0.05" length="0.4"/>
      </geometry>
      <material name="blue">
        <color rgba="0.0 0.0 0.8 1.0"/>
      </material>
    </visual>
    <collision>
       <geometry>
        <cylinder radius="0.05" length="0.4"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    <inertial>
      <mass value="2.0"/>
      <inertia ixx="1.0" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0" iyy="1.0" iyz="0.0" izz="1.0"/>
    </inertial>
  </link>

  <!-- 3. The Joint: Connecting Torso to Arm -->
  <joint name="right_shoulder_joint" type="revolute">
    <parent link="torso"/>
    <child link="right_upper_arm"/>
    <!-- Position this joint at the top right corner of the torso box -->
    <origin xyz="0.0 -0.35 0.1" rpy="0 0 0"/> 
    <!-- The arm rotates around its local Y-axis -->
    <axis xyz="0 1 0"/>
    <limit lower="-1.57" upper="1.57" velocity="1.0" effort="10.0"/>
  </joint>

</robot>
```

From here, you would continue the chain: add a `right_elbow_joint` and a `right_lower_arm` link, and so on for every part of the robot's body.

## Visualizing and Validating Your URDF

You don't need a full simulator to see if your URDF is correct. ROS provides tools to parse and display your model. The most common tool is **RViz**. You can launch `robot_state_publisher`, which reads the URDF and publishes the coordinate frame transformations, and then view the resulting 3D model in RViz. This is an essential debugging step to ensure your links and joints are positioned correctly.

## URDF vs. SDF

While URDF is standard for describing a single robot's kinematics, you will also encounter **SDF (Simulation Description Format)**, especially when working with the Gazebo simulator.

*   **URDF:** Describes the kinematics and dynamics of a *single robot*.
*   **SDF:** Describes *everything* in a simulation world, including multiple robots, lights, obstacles, and environmental physics.

Gazebo works best with SDF, but it has excellent support for converting URDF files on the fly. For most ROS applications, defining your robot in URDF (often with extensions like Xacro for easier editing) is the standard practice.

Understanding URDF is non-negotiable for robotics. It is the universal language for defining a robot's structure, forming the foundation upon which all simulation, visualization, and control are built.
