Welcome to the AI-Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This introductory chapter sets the stage for understanding the convergence of artificial intelligence and the physical world.

## The Dawn of Embodied Intelligence

For decades, AI has largely resided in digital realms, excelling at tasks within virtual environments. However, the next frontier for AI is in the physical world, where intelligence interacts with gravity, friction, and the complexities of real-world physics. This is "Physical AI"—systems that are not just smart, but also embodied, capable of perception, decision-making, and action in physical space.

Humanoid robots, with their human-like form, are at the forefront of this revolution. Their design allows for intuitive interaction with human environments and tools, promising a future where robots seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, assisting in various tasks from manufacturing to healthcare and personal companionship.

## Course Overview

This textbook is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical AI knowledge and practical application in robotics. Over four modules, you will explore:

1.  **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Understand the middleware that enables robust robot control and communication.
2.  **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Learn to simulate complex physical environments and robot interactions.
3.  **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)**: Dive into advanced perception, simulation, and training with NVIDIA's powerful platform.
4.  **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Explore the cutting-edge convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotics to enable intuitive voice commands and cognitive planning.

A dedicated section on **Hardware Requirements** will guide you through setting up the necessary computational and robotic equipment for hands-on learning.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this course, you will be able to:

*   Understand the principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence.
*   Master ROS 2 for robotic control and communication.
*   Simulate robots and environments using Gazebo and Unity.
*   Develop AI-powered perception and manipulation with NVIDIA Isaac.
*   Design and control humanoid robots for natural interactions.
